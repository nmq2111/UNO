PSEUDOCODE – RUMMY GAME (PLAYER VS COMPUTER)
-------------------------------------------------------

DESK&SETUP FUNCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------
1. createDeck()
Create an array of all UNO cards:

4 colors (red, blue, green, yellow)

Numbers 0-9 (one 0, two of each 1-9)

Action cards (Skip, Reverse, +2)

Wild cards (Wild, Wild +4)

✅ Once you can generate the full deck, you're good for next step.

2. shuffleDeck(deck)
Write a function that randomizes the order of the cards.

(Use Fisher–Yates shuffle — it's the best.)

✅ After shuffling, you have a playable deck!

3. dealCards(player, computer, deck)
Deal 7 cards each to player and computer.

Remove those cards from the deck.

✅ Now each player has a hand, and the deck is smaller.

4. initializeGame()
This function calls createDeck(), shuffleDeck(), dealCards(), and puts 1 card face-up to start the discard pile.

✅ Now the game is set up ready to start turns.

        - Pick card from deck
        - Pick card from discard pile

    IF deck selected:
        CALL drawCard("player")
    ELSE IF discard pile selected:
        TAKE top card from discard pile

    CALL ADD("player", drawnCard)

    PROMPT player to discard one card
    REMOVE selected card from hand
    PLACE it on top of discard pile

    IF player clicks "Complete":
        IF checkHandValidity(playerHand) == TRUE:
            IF totalPointsGrouped(playerHand) >= 30 OR NOT firstRound:
                CALL declareWinner("player")
                END GAME
            ELSE:
                DISPLAY "Minimum 30 points needed in first round"
        ELSE:
            DISPLAY "Invalid Hand!"

    // COMPUTER TURN

        TAKE top discard
    ELSE:
        CALL drawCard("computer")

    DECIDE card to discard (basic AI strategy)
    PLACE card on top of discard pile

    IF checkHandValidity(computerHand) == TRUE:
        IF totalPointsGrouped(computerHand) >= 30 OR NOT firstRound:
            CALL declareWinner("computer")
            END GAME
