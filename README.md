# üÉè UNO Game (Player vs Computer)

UNO is a fast card game where players match cards by color or number to get rid of all their cards first. The deck has four colors (red, green, blue, yellow), numbers 0‚Äì9, and special cards like Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, and Wilds. Players start with 7 cards and must play a matching card or draw if they can't. When down to one card, they must shout "UNO!" to win. The first player with no cards left wins the game.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

1. Each player gets 7 cards.
2. Place the rest of the deck face down; flip one card to start the discard pile.
3. On your turn, match the top card by color, number, or symbol.
4. If you can't play, draw a card from the deck. If it matches, you can play it; if not, you keep it.
5. Use action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two) to change the game.
6. Wild cards let you pick any color; Wild Draw Four makes the next player draw four cards.
7. When you have one card left, shout "UNO!" before your turn ends.
8. If you forget to say "UNO" and someone catches you, draw two cards as a penalty.
9. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!
